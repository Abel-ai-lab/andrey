    """Learn a DAG with CAM, the causal additive model (nonlinear additive effects).

    CAM [1]_ models each variable as a sum of smooth functions of its parents plus Gaussian noise,
    ``x_j = sum_k f_jk(x_k) + e_j``, which identifies the DAG when the functions are nonlinear. It
    preselects each variable's possible parents by boosting, adds edges greedily by the drop in the
    log residual variance until the DAG is complete within them, and prunes the edges whose smooth
    terms are not significant. It returns a DAG and a causal order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_variables)
        Observed data, one row per sample. Coerced to ``float64``. A DataFrame's column names
        become the structure's ``labels``.
    alpha : float, default=0.001
        The significance level of the pruning test: a parent stays when its smooth term's p-value
        is at most ``alpha``, in ``(0, 1)``. ``0.001`` is the paper's value, which it keeps at every
        sample size and advises raising for small samples.
    knowledge : Knowledge or None, default=None
        Background knowledge, a :class:`~andrey.Knowledge`: required and forbidden edges, the pairs
        allowed to be adjacent, and temporal tiers, all honored. Forbidden edges, edges into an
        earlier tier, and pairs outside the allowed set are never possible parents; the boosting
        that preselects the possible parents reads the data alone. The search starts from the
        required edges and the pruning never removes one. The causal order puts the cause of each
        required edge, and every earlier tier, first.

    Returns
    -------
    StructureOutput
        Wraps a ``dag`` :class:`~andrey.core.GraphStructure`; ``metadata["algorithm"]`` is
        ``"cam"`` and ``metadata["tie_break"]`` the rule ties followed. ``ordering`` is a causal
        order of the search's DAG before pruning, as a tuple of column indices, causes first.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``knowledge`` is neither ``None`` nor a :class:`~andrey.Knowledge`.
    ValueError
        If an argument has the wrong type, lies outside its range, or is not one of its choices; the
        message names the method, the argument, what it accepts, and the value. Also if ``data`` is
        not a usable 2-D matrix: not numeric, holding ``NaN`` or ``inf``, or with a constant column,
        a column of fewer than 3 distinct values, or a column that repeats another up to scale and
        shift, each named in the message. Also if ``knowledge`` names a column ``data`` lacks or
        contradicts itself, as :class:`~andrey.Knowledge` lists.

    Warns
    -----
    ExperimentalWarning
        On the first call in a process: the method has no published benchmark, and its API may
        change without deprecation.

    Notes
    -----
    **When to use it.** CAM suits continuous data whose effects are nonlinear and additive in the
    parents, with additive noise and no unmeasured common causes [1]_. Its score is the Gaussian
    likelihood of that model.

    **When not to.** With linear effects and Gaussian noise only the Markov equivalence class is
    identified, and the orientation of the edges it leaves undirected is arbitrary: use
    :func:`~andrey.pc` or :func:`~andrey.ges`. Noise whose scale depends on the parents
    (location-scale data) can reverse edges, because the model's noise variance is fixed.

    **The steps.** The paper's settings, in its three steps [1]_:

    1. *Neighbor preselection.* Each variable is regressed on all the others by componentwise L2
       boosting [2]_, 100 iterations of step size 0.1, with one P-spline base learner per other
       variable [3]_: a cubic B-spline basis on 20 equidistant interior knots over the variable's
       range, a second-order difference penalty, and the penalty weight that gives the learner 4
       degrees of freedom. The possible parents are the ten variables picked most often, among
       those picked at least three times. When more than ten qualify, the ones picked more often
       than the eleventh stay, so a tie at the tenth place keeps fewer than ten rather than
       choosing by column order.
    2. *Order search.* From the empty graph, the search adds the edge ``i -> j`` whose fit most
       lowers the log residual variance of ``j``, among the possible parents that close no cycle,
       whatever the sign of the change, and refits only ``j``'s remaining candidates, until none
       is left. Each fit is an additive model of penalized thin plate regression splines with ten
       basis functions per parent and smoothing chosen by GCV [4]_; with fewer than 30 rows per
       parent each term gets ``ceil(n_samples / (3 n_parents))`` functions, at least 3, and a
       variable with fewer distinct values than that gets one per distinct value. The paper states
       no cap on a variable's parents, and the search sets none; a candidate whose model would have
       as many coefficients as rows is never added.
    3. *Pruning.* Each variable is fit on its parents in that DAG, and a parent stays when its
       smooth term's p-value [5]_ is at most ``alpha``, the paper's rule.

    The rescaling of a column changes no step: the base learners and the smooth terms read a
    variable through an affine map to a fixed interval, and each gain is a ratio of residual
    variances. The fit draws no random numbers and runs on one BLAS thread.

    **Ties.** The fit runs on the columns ordered by a rank computed from each column's own data,
    as for :func:`~andrey.hc`: two edges with exactly equal gains go to the one whose child, then
    parent, ranks first, and so do the variables the causal order could place next, so the result
    does not depend on the column order unless two columns are identical. The :doc:`column-order
    guide </docs/guides/column-order>` says what the rank keeps under a new column order.

    **Missing values.** A ``NaN`` in ``data`` raises ``ValueError``: every fit reads every row of
    its variables, so a row with a missing value has no place in it. Drop the incomplete rows
    first, which suits values missing completely at random, or use :func:`~andrey.pc` or
    :func:`~andrey.fci`, whose tests delete rows per test.

    **Limitations.** Not benchmarked yet.
